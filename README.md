## 🚀 Project Overview

This full-stack application leverages computer vision to classify potato leaf diseases from images.

* **Frontend:** React.js — intuitive UI for image upload and result display
* **Backend:** Python Flask API — image processing and disease prediction model

---

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Frontend (React)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

* Opens the app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
* Drag & drop your potato leaf image to get predictions instantly

---

### 2. Backend API (Flask)

```bash
cd api
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

* Starts the prediction API server on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
* Ensure the backend is running before using the frontend

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* React.js, Material-UI
* Python, FastAPI
* TensorFlow/Keras (or your chosen ML framework)
* Image processing libraries (Pillow, OpenCV)

---

## 🎯 How It Works

1. Upload a potato leaf image on the frontend.
2. Image sent to backend API for processing and classification.
3. Model predicts the disease class and sends results back.
4. Results displayed in the UI with actionable insights.
